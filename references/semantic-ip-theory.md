## 📌 Preamble: Language Has Changed

With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), language is no longer just a communication tool or cultural carrier, but has become a parsable, decomposable, and codable computational resource.

The "semantic structure" of language is being:
- Vectorized
- Subject to agent chaining
- Absorbed internally by models (model embedding)

This makes language no longer just an "expression form" protected by copyright, but something that should be further viewed as orchestratable, computable "semantic capital."

## 🧩 Core Assertion: Semantic Module = Semantic Property

| Element | Traditional Copyright | Open Source Code | Semantic Module (LOL) |
|---------|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Content Unit | Articles, Images | Functions, Scripts | Prompts, Tone Flows, Narrative Rhythms |
| Usage Mode | Read, Reproduce | Compile, Refactor | Disassemble, Nest, Semantic Mapping |
| Economic Behavior | License, Publish | Release, Fork | Prompt market, embedding, Agent API |
| Control Position | Author → Reader | Developer → User | Semantic Designer → Language Actor (Human or Agent) |

The semantic module itself is a type of **Semantic Property** with functionality and governance logic.

## 🏛 Theoretical Reference Basis

### 1. Pragmatics

Speech acts are not merely information transmission, but institutionalized social actions (Searle, Austin).

The tone, rhythm, and narrative logic in semantic modules are replicable "pragmatic devices" and should not be infinitely copied or embedded in AI systems.

### 2. Syntactic Governance

In AI models and agent systems, syntax = operating rules; semantics = control behavior.
Prompts and semantic modules are new "syntactic institutional units."

LOL terms serve as an intellectual property firewall at the syntactic level.

### 3. Extension of Legal Philosophy: Functional IP

When the logical structure of content can be reused, executed, or constitute a functional module, it goes beyond traditional copyright.
Semantic modules should be considered a **new type of intellectual property between code and language**, requiring protection that bridges content law and logic design law.

## 🧠 Extended Definition: Semantic IP

> Semantic IP refers to language modules, tone structures, and narrative flows that can be structured for use, lead to specific semantic behaviors, and be embedded in AI systems to produce functional effects.

It includes but is not limited to:
- Prompt frameworks and logic modules
- Dialogue structures and tone rhythms
- Modular narrative flows, role dispatch logic
- Semantic chains and control token sequences

## 🧰 Why Language Ontology License?

Traditional Copyright:
- Cannot protect structure mapping after language vectorization
- Cannot identify if an AI agent is a user

Open Source Terms (MIT / Apache):
- Cannot license semantic modules for human reading only while prohibiting AI use
- Cannot establish legal boundaries for prompt usage / chaining / embedding

Creative Commons:
- Cannot regulate sentence behavior, semantic replication, and module reconstruction

LOL, as a dedicated Semantic IP license, is currently the only language protection mechanism in the semantic governance field designed for the AI generation.

## 🏛 Suggestions for Legal Development (Future Research Directions)

- Semantic modules need special laws to define usage rights and semantic liability
- Prompt markets need to establish "sentence contract" and "module labeling" systems
- If AI systems reuse semantic modules, they should comply with "semantic traceability" and "usage exclusion" principles
- Can be studied as one of the supplementary draft specifications for the EU AI Act (Annex for Prompt Licensing)
