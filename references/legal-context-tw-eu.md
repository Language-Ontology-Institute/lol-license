## 🇹🇼 Taiwan Legal Context

### 1. Copyright Act (Amended in Republic of China Year 84 / 1995)

- "Language modules" can be considered a type of "literary work" with originality.
- Articles 5 and 9 of the Copyright Act protect the form of expression (not concepts or ideas).
- Based on practical precedents, Prompts, dialogue modules, and narrative structures are protected if they possess creative arrangement.
- Protection is automatic without the need for registration.

### 2. Civil Code Contract Terms

- Using LOL licensing terms constitutes a "unilateral license contract."
- Violation of terms constitutes grounds for "license termination" (handled under Civil Code Articles 153 and 245).

### 3. Ministry of Digital Affairs / NSTC Policy Alignment

- The Taiwan government has not defined clear legal boundaries for AI training data.
- However, LOL terms help guide the generative AI industry to establish reasonable licensing and liability systems.
- Has the potential to be included in the "Trustworthy AI Self-Regulation" framework.

## 🇪🇺 EU Legal Context

### 1. EU Copyright Directive (Directive 2019/790)

- Explicitly states that copyright covers "digital works" and "machine-readable formats."
- Recognizes language structures and module combinations as protected works (refer to Article 3).

### 2. Text and Data Mining (TDM) Clauses

- While TDM for research purposes is allowed, Article 4 stipulates: **If the rights holder explicitly reserves rights, it cannot be used.**
- LOL terms, if embedding "no TDM" language, have legal effect (technical measures marking can be added).

### 3. AI Act (Artificial Intelligence Act Draft)

- The draft emphasizes: Must label training sources and respect the will of data owners.
- LOL terms can serve as "Language Module Usage Rules / Usage Restriction Statements."
- Compatible with Transparency Obligations.

## 📚 International Legal Research Supplement

| Legal Source Type | Corresponding Implication |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 🇺🇸 US Law | Copyright law focuses on expression form; if LOL terms explicitly mark module structure, they can protect semantic arrangement and interaction flow. |
| 🇯🇵 Japan Law | Separates creation protection and fair use; LOL can serve as licensing terms limiting AI usage scenarios. |
| 🌍 WIPO | No clear terms for semantic modules and AI prompts yet; LOL can serve as a draft starting point for new semantic rights. |
