## 💬 Summary Explanation

- **LOL is Semantic Module Oriented**: Uses language as institution and tone as structure to design controllable semantic module licensing terms.
- **CC is Designed for Human Creative Commons**: Lacks ability to handle language structure regarding AI and agent behaviors.
- **MIT / Apache are Code-Oriented Licenses**: Cannot structurally protect prompts or semantic models.
- **LOL Adopts "Clause Modularization" Strategy**: Future extension of terms possible, maintaining flexibility and clear boundaries.

## 📌 Licensing Logic Comparison: Usage vs. Narrative vs. Semantics

| License Type | Core Governance Unit | Applicable Scope | Boundary Setting Method |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| MIT / Apache | User Behavior | Source Code | Defined limits via code behavior |
| CC Series | Copyright Content | Multimedia Content (Image, Video, Text) | Controlled via citation and reproduction authorization |
| **LOL** | Semantic Module Entity | Tone, Narrative Module, Prompt, Flow Sentences | Sets usability and boundaries via semantic behavior clauses |
