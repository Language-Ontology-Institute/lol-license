Language Ontology License Clause Subset: AI Agent Behavior Specifications

---

## 📌 Purpose

This section explicitly regulates the use, translation, and invocation behaviors of AI Agents, ensuring that semantic modules are not abused by unauthorized agent chains or multi-agent collaboration architectures.

---

## 🔒 Clause Content

1. **No Unauthorized Semantic Agent Invocation**
   - AI systems must not invoke this semantic module as an intermediary agent for language processing or generation tasks unless explicitly authorized.

2. **No Embedding or Encapsulation in AI Agent SDKs**
   - Semantic modules must not be used as module components in AI agent builders or SDK packages, nor should they be bundled into execution flows by default.

3. **Must Display Agent Identity and Semantic Source Chain**
   - Whenever users obtain semantic output through an agent, the source semantic module and license attribution must be displayed synchronously.

4. **No Cross-Semantic Layer Replication of Tone Modules**
   - If a semantic module involves tone or narrative control, AI systems must not perform cross-module invocation or disassemble it to reassemble a separate agent module.

## 🧬 Scope of Application

- Agent builder platforms (e.g., Langchain, AutoGPT)
- Multi-agent chained execution architectures
- Agent services containing automatic prompt-routing
