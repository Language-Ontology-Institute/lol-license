Language Ontology License Clause Subset: No Forking Semantic Modules Clause

---

## 📌 Purpose

To prohibit unauthorized parties from structurally forking semantic modules, recombining tones, or generating new modules using mirrored semantics.
This clause emphasizes the integrity and originality of tone and semantic structure, which must not be disassembled and modified to be relabeled as new work.

## 🔒 Clause Content

1. **No Forking of Prompt Structures to Generate Variant Modules**
   - Even if only individual words or tone configurations are changed, it shall not be considered a new module unless explicit authorization is obtained from the creator.

2. **No Mirroring of Tone Modules**
   - It is prohibited to simulate the original module's language sense using the same tone logic and response rhythm and relabel it as a new creation.

3. **No Reproduction of Usage Logic in Closed Systems**
   - Whether publicly published or not, reproducing the semantic rhythm of the original module within a closed-source system also constitutes infringement.
