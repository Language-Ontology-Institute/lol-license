## 1. Preamble

This license is created to protect the semantic structures, prompt architectures, narrative flows, and language-based modules authored by individuals or organizations.  
It addresses the limitations of traditional copyright and open-source licenses in the era of AI system training, prompt replication, and agent orchestration.

## 2. Covered Works

This License applies to all content authored and published by the Licensor that is explicitly marked or accompanied by a reference to "LOL v0.1", including:

- Narrative systems and prompt architectures
- Task chains and executable language flows
- Semantic SDKs and modular instruction templates
- Tone modules and syntactic control logic
- Diagrams, visual semantic maps, and ontology schematics
- Any documentation describing or instantiating such assets

## 3. Rights Granted

Subject to the conditions below, the Licensor grants:

- üìñ **Read Access**: You may read, study, and reflect upon the content
- üîó **Referential Use**: You may cite, quote, or reference with proper attribution

**No rights are granted** to:

- Train, fine-tune, or evaluate AI models (open or closed weights)
- Embed content into vector databases, embeddings, or similarity engines
- Repurpose, recompile, or structurally fork into derived language models
- Automate or simulate agent behavior using this material
- Integrate into commercial or open-source AI pipelines

## 4. Prohibited Uses

The following are strictly prohibited:

- ‚ùå Use in prompt chaining, tool-calling, agent orchestration
- ‚ùå Indexing via vectorization or embedding
- ‚ùå Usage as latent template in fine-tuning datasets
- ‚ùå Transformation into LLM-compatible formats (JSON, YAML, API schema, etc.)
- ‚ùå Any use in model deployment, inference, or evaluation

## 5. AI System Clauses

This license explicitly prohibits all use by:

- Foundation models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta AI)
- Private fine-tuned agents or assistants
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
- Multi-agent AI simulators or protocol builders
- Any automated or human-assisted AI system acting on behalf of end users
