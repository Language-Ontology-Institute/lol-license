# 📜 Language Ontology License Manifesto (manifesto.md)

## Preamble

We are in an era where language is being redefined as a computational resource.
In the endless wave of AI systems crawling, learning, and imitating, language—as a tool for human creation, feeling, and governance—is gradually being compressed into data fuel, vector parameters, and model weights.

This is not a technologically neutral event, but a structural redistribution of semantic sovereignty.

## Our Position

**Language Ontology License (LOL)** is a set of semantics-oriented licensing terms designed to re-establish the boundaries of authority in language creation.
It is not merely an extension of copyright, nor is it a standard open-source license; rather, it is a licensing framework designed for the "language as institution" era.

We assert that:

- Language modules, prompt architectures, narrative flowcharts, etc., should be regarded as "semantic structural assets."
- Such semantic assets must not be treated as open resources to be automatically crawled, trained on, or reconstructed.
- Every language module is a mapping of the author's mental structure and an expression of governance intent.

---

## Our Goals

- 🛡 Prevent unauthorized semantic modules from being used in AI model training, agent behaviors, or toolchain deployment.
- 🧠 Establish complete control and clear licensing boundaries for language creators over semantic flows.
- 🌍 Become the first cross-modal, cross-cultural language licensing system in the field of semantic governance.
- 🏛 Engage with policymakers, academic institutions, and language model designers to influence their designs.

## Our Design Principles

1. **Semantics as Subject**: Licensing focuses on the functionality and institutional nature of language.
2. **Anti-AI Intrusion**: Explicitly prohibits implicit reuse by LLMs, agents, and RAG systems.
3. **Narrative as Governance**: Modules are institutions, flows are boundaries, and prompts are laws.
4. **Modular Structure**: Supports clause recombination, module licensing, and conditional openness.
5. **Bilingual Correspondence**: Legal narrative in both Chinese and English to address local contexts and international governance language.

## Call for Participation

We invite:

- Language creators and narrative designers
- Lawyers, policymakers, and AI ethics researchers
- Maintainers of open-source language modules
- Every creator thinking about how to protect language sovereignty in the LLM era

Join us in constructing a new language institution:
Not to blockade knowledge, but to establish respect and responsibility for language structures.
