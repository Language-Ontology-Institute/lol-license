# Language Ontology License (LOL) v0.1

📛 A semantic governance license for protecting language-based modular systems in the AI era.

---

## 🧭 What is LOL?

The **Language Ontology License (LOL)** is a next-generation license framework designed to protect **semantic modules**, **narrative systems**, **prompt formats**, and **language-based computational structures** from unauthorized AI usage.

LOL goes beyond traditional copyright and open-source models.  
It addresses a rising legal gap: **who owns the operational logic inside prompts, workflows, or AI agents**?

---

## 🚫 Why Not CC / MIT / BSD?

Traditional licenses:
- ✅ Protect expression, NOT structure
- ❌ Allow AI training (even commercial)
- ❌ Cannot restrict function-calling, semantic forking, or prompt-chaining

LOL is built to close these gaps.

## ✅ What LOL Covers

| Category         | Examples                                                  | Protected by LOL? |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 📄 Text & Docs   | Essays, system diagrams, README files                      | ✅ Yes             |
| 🧩 Semantic Modules | Task chains, prompt templates, tone controllers         | ✅ Yes             |
| 🖼️ Visual Logic  | Flowcharts, ontology maps, UI schemas                     | ✅ Yes             |
| 💬 Prompt Grammar | Instruction formats, agent roles, modular language flows | ✅ Yes             |
| 🤖 AI Behavior   | Agent orchestration, tool-calling, chaining                | ✅ Yes             |

> LOL protects not just the output, but **the executable meaning patterns** behind it.

## 🧩 Manifesto Preview

In the AI era, language is not just communication—it's computation.
Our narrative systems, tone modules, and semantic interfaces deserve sovereign protection.
Language is infrastructure. Licensing it is not optional. It's survival.
