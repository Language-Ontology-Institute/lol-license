# Language Ontology License (LOL) v0.1

📛 A semantic governance license for protecting language-based modular systems in the AI era.

---

## 📘 About This Project

This project defines a language-based framework for authorization, usage control, and AI interaction design.  
It is not a variant of Creative Commons or traditional open-source licenses, but a governance-oriented semantic structure.

This repository contains an original framework designed to define language-based authorization logic and usage rules for human–AI interaction systems. 

## 🛡️ Usage and Attribution Guidelines

Do not adapt or reinterpret this agreement in other conceptual contexts without permission. Misuse may result in semantic distortion and loss of intended meaning.

For academic citation, policy application, or derivative frameworks, please contact the original author to ensure accurate contextual alignment and semantic integrity.

Any reframing of this license in alternate theoretical or academic contexts requires prior written permission from the original author.

## 🧭 What is LOL?

The **Language Ontology License (LOL)** is a next-generation license framework designed to protect **semantic modules**, **narrative systems**, **prompt formats**, and **language-based computational structures** from unauthorized AI usage.

LOL goes beyond traditional copyright and open-source models.  
It addresses a rising legal gap: **who owns the operational logic inside prompts, workflows, or AI agents**?

As language becomes the substrate of computation, the structures that govern its use must also be governed.

## 🚫 Why Not CC / MIT / BSD?

Traditional licenses:
- ✅ Protect expression, NOT structure
- ❌ Allow AI training (even commercial)
- ❌ Cannot restrict function-calling, semantic forking, or prompt-chaining

LOL is built to close these gaps.

## ✅ What LOL Covers

| Category         | Examples                                                  | Protected by LOL? |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 📄 Text & Docs   | Essays, system diagrams, README files                      | ✅ Yes             |
| 🧩 Semantic Modules | Task chains, prompt templates, tone controllers         | ✅ Yes             |
| 🖼️ Visual Logic  | Flowcharts, ontology maps, UI schemas                     | ✅ Yes             |
| 💬 Prompt Grammar | Instruction formats, agent roles, modular language flows | ✅ Yes             |
| 🤖 AI Behavior   | Agent orchestration, tool-calling, chaining                | ✅ Yes             |

> LOL protects not just the output, but **the executable meaning patterns** behind it.

## 🧩 Manifesto Preview

In the AI era, language is not just communication—it's computation.
Our narrative systems, tone modules, and semantic interfaces deserve sovereign protection.
Language is infrastructure. Licensing it is not optional. It's survival.
